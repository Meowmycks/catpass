# catpass
An arguably competent password manager.

It's a password manager.
It uses Python 3.6, and it's command-line based.
It uses <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pycryptodome/">Pycryptodome</a>, so you'll need to install that if there's ever a problem with missing modules.

First, you give it a passphrase to encrypt your passwords with.
Then, you start adding your passwords to it.
Finally, you exit the program and save your passwords.
To access them again, use the passphrase you created the first time to decrypt your passwords.

Maybe don't use this in the real world?
Unless you don't mind the missing convenience that actual password managers like Dashlane provides.
