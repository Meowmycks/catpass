# catpass
An arguably competent password manager.

It's a password manager.
It uses Python 3.6, and it's command-line based.
It uses <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pycryptodome/">Pycryptodome</a>, so you'll need to install that if there's ever a problem with missing modules.

First, you give it a passphrase to encrypt your passwords with.
Then, you start adding your passwords to it and changing them if you need to.
Finally, you exit the program and save your passwords.
To access them again, use the passphrase you created the first time to decrypt your passwords.

This is a very brief explanation of what it does, use it or look at the code to see what it can do.

Maybe don't use this in the real world?
Unless you don't mind the lack-of-convenience that actual password managers like Dashlane provide.
